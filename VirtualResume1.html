		<p id="firstblog">I am a 9th grade student (as of May 2020), and I have just finsihed my first year at Western Ablemarle High School in Crozet Virgina. I enjoy computer science, basketball, video games, and carpentry. This year I satarted at power forward for our varsity basketball team, we made it to the District Championship but lost in a close game. We did however win the Regional Championship and made it all the way to the State Semi-Finals. I was getting ready to start my AAU season when right before my first practice school's shutdown due to the Coronavirus Pandemic. I have loved computer science since elementary school when I first learned how to make a simple game on Scratch, the free simplyfied coding tool for kids. I also have done many coding and robotics camps at the local community college PVCC. This year I have continued that learning by taking my first coding class at School. I started to learn the basics of Java and have been recommended to go to AP next year. I have always loved playing video games by myself or with friends since my first Wii, since then I have played on an Xbox and a Ps4. My favorite system however is my PC that I built in the sixth grade with my dad. It was both of ours first PC build and it was lots of fun and still works to this day!! Since starting my new job yesterday (Wednseday May 28, 2020) I have learned a lot about coding, I have learned how to code a simple HTML site with a survey, images, links, titles, headers, and more. It's been a lot of fun, and very helpful. I have also started a journal with notes about the things I have learned and my goals and plan for this summer.</p>
